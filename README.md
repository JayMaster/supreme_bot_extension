# supreme_bot_extension

The fashion brand Supreme (supremenewyork.com) is based on artifical shortage of their apparel, thus leading to immense hype. Every Thursday at 12pm (CET), there is a "drop" of new Supreme clothes and accessories. As the re-sell price is sometimes much higher than the retail price, this poses an arbitrage opportunity. However, the most popular clothes are sometimes sold out after less than jaw-dropping 1.5 seconds.
This Chrome extension is a swift, highly-competitive bot to rapidly order apparel from supremenewyork.com on Thursday at 12pm.

This bot was built for educational purposes only and should not be used. It is possible to set a cart's price to 0â‚¬.

Even though it has been published only now, it is messy and out-dated. Do not expect a friendly UI :))
